1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. error because it can only be accessed within block
5. error because const can not be modified.
6. error because const can not be modified
1b:
1.2 Because var can use out side the loop
2. 150. var can be used for out side of the loop. It will contain the last object's result which is 150
3. 150 var can be used for out side of the loop. The line 8 multiply the answer by 100 then divide it by 100. Therefore, it becomes 150
4. [50, 100, 150] Because discounted is a list of finalPrice
5. it will print out error because let is only vaild inside the loop. 
6. it will cause an error becuase discountedPrice is declared inside the loop
7. it will be 0; because it is declared as 0 out side of the loop
8. it will return empty list because the discounted is a let type. It is inilized as empty.
9. it will be an error because i is declared inside the loop. 
10. length will be 3. The length is inilized as the length of the list named prices.
11. [50, 100, 150], the push operation can modify const variable. 
Data Types: 
12. 
A: student.name;

B: student['Grad Year'];

C: student.greeting();

D: student['Favorite Teacher'].name;

E: student.courseLoad[0];


13. A: '32' anything add operation with '' the compiler will view it as a string

    Bï¼š1 it is a minus and the compiler recoginzes the number
    
    C: 3 3+null = 3+0 = 3
    
    D: '3null' the compiler view '3' as an string opertion
    
    E: 4 the compiler view true = 1 1+null=1
    
    F: 0 the compiler view false = 0 0+null=0
    
    G: '3undefined' view '3' as a string operation
    
    F: NaN anything asscoiate will undefined will cause a result of NaN
    
    
14. A: true compiler recoginzes '2' as 2, 2>1 is true
15. 
    B: false 1's charCode=49, 2's charCode=50, 50>49
    
    C: true Number('2')=2;
    
    D: false they are not the same type 
    
    E: false true =1 
    
    F: true they are both Boolean type Boolean(2) is true
    
15. == do conver and compare
    === only do compare if they are not the same type, return false
    
17. it will return an array of [2,4,6]
    the modifyArray will get an array of [1,2,3],and doSomething as parameters. Then it will create an array called newArr that will be used for return. Then the for loop modify every element of the [1,2,3] by calling the function doSomething. The doSomething function will multiply it's parameter by 2 and return. Then the reuslt will push into the const newArr. Therefore, this program will give us an array of [2,4,6] at the end.
